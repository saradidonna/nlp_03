## Segment vs. Document level Machine Translation 

## Description
 This project aims to explore current limitations in machine translation models trained on sentence-level data. A [Marian MT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/marian) transformer was used to translate two texts of similar nature from English into Italian. Data was evaluated by leveraging [COMET-22](https://aclanthology.org/2022.wmt-1.52/) and [Unbabel Qi](https://qi.unbabel.com/).

### Dependencies
In order to run the scripts, the following should be installed:
- Python 3.10.12 or higher 
- pytorch
- sacremoses
- transformers
- unbabel-comet
